This is a short description of the MarvelMind GPS driver software installation.

Functionality:
	This driver is not suited for commercial use.
	This driver is only designed to accept Marvelmind communication messages.
	Which means that no configuration is done.
	It disables the Ashtech gps driver and reads the $GP gps messages and posts them to the uORB.

2-versions exist of the driver, (gps_v1 and gps_v2).

gps_v1 is designed to function in the PX4 autopilot pro flight stacked located at:
	https://github.com/PX4/Firmware

gps_v2 is designed to function for a custom px4 autopilot pro flight stack located at:
	https://github.com/darenlee/PixhawkPSP_Firmware

place the files located in gps_v2/devices/src into the following folder:
	../px4/Firmware/src/drivers/gps/devices/src

place the files located in gps_v2 into the following folder:
	../px4/Firmware/src/drivers/gps

In the file ../px4/Firmware/src/drivers/gps/CMakeLists.txt, include the Marvelmind driver by adding the line
