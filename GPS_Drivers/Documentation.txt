This is a short description of the MarvelMind GPS driver software installation.

Functionality:
	This driver is not suited for commercial use.
	This driver is only designed to accept Marvelmind communication messages.
	Which means that no configuration is done.
	It disables the Ashtech gps driver and reads the $GP gps messages and posts them to the uORB.

2-versions exist of the driver, (gps_v1 and gps_v2).

gps_v1 is designed to function in the PX4 autopilot pro flight stacked located at:
	https://github.com/PX4/Firmware

gps_v2 is designed to function for a custom px4 autopilot pro flight stack located at:
	https://github.com/darenlee/PixhawkPSP_Firmware


Given the PX4 firmware folder in ../px4;

place the files located in gps_v2/devices/src into the following folder:
	../px4/Firmware/src/drivers/gps/devices/src

place the files located in gps_v2 into the following folder:
	../px4/Firmware/src/drivers/gps

In the file ../px4/Firmware/src/drivers/gps/CMakeLists.txt, include the Marvelmind driver by adding the line
	devices/src/marv.cpp

In the file ../px4/Firmware/src/drivers/drv_gps.h, include the Marvelmind driver mode in the enumeration
	GPS_DRIVER_MODE_MARVELMIND

3-versions exist of the driver, (gps_v1, gps_v2 and gps_v3).

gps_v1 is designed to function in the PX4 autopilot pro flight stacked located at:
	https://github.com/PX4/Firmware

gps_v2 is designed to function for a custom px4 autopilot pro flight stack located at:

gps_v3 is designed to function for a custom px4 autopilot pro flight stack located at:
	https://github.com/mathworks/PX4âˆ’Firmware

Given the PX4 firmware folder in ../px4;

place the files located in gps_v3/devices/src into the following folder:
	../px4/Firmware/src/drivers/gps/devices/src

In the file ../px4/Firmware/src/drivers/gps/CMakeLists.txt, include the Marvelmind driver by adding the line
	devices/src/marv.cpp

In the file ../px4/Firmware/src/drivers/drv_gps.h, include the Marvelmind driver mode in the enumeration
	GPS_DRIVER_MODE_MARVELMIND

In the file ../px4/Firmware/src/drivers/gps/gps.cpp, add the following lines:
	on line 89, include the marvelmind driver
	#include "devices/src/marv.h"

	on line 699, 
		case GPS_DRIVER_MODE_MARVELMIND:
                            _helper = new GPSDriverMarvelmind(&GPS::callback, this, &_report_gps_pos, _p_report_sat_info);

	line 790:

	becomes	_mode = GPS_DRIVER_MODE_MARVELMIND;

	line 794:
	is 	_mode = GPS_DRIVER_MODE_UBX;
	becomes _mode = GPS_DRIVER_MODE_MARVELMIND;

	Add on line 798:
		case GPS_DRIVER_MODE_MARVELMIND:
                	_mode = GPS_DRIVER_MODE_UBX;
                        usleep(500000); // tried all possible drivers. Wait a bit before next round
                        break;

	Add on line 880:
		case GPS_DRIVER_MODE_MARVELMIND:
			PX4_INFO("protocol: MARVELMIND");
			break;

	Add on line 1101:
		} else if (!strcmp(myoptarg, "marv")) {
                                mode = GPS_DRIVER_MODE_MARVELMIND;

An example of the changes are included in gps_v3/gps.cpp. You can try copying this file to ../px4/Firmware/src/drivers/gps/gps.cpp, if it does not work, make the changes manually.
