\chapter{What did we learn?}
\section{Finished:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item If we want to arm the motors, the RC NEEDS to be connected, otherwise the motors will stay disarmed. This feature is inherited from the PX4 flight stack.
	In nsh run px4io status to see the arming status and the servo outputs (motor pwm values).
\end{itemize}

\section{Temporary Fix:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item CSC Parameters provided by the PSP from Matlab results in an error during building, which is due to the fact that it tries to include a file which has a path which the cmake procedure can not handle. Main guess would be that it includes a space somewhere. \textbf{Temporary Solution:} In the software, all Pixhawk\_CSC instances are removed in file InitFcn\_R2017b.m and it is saved as InitFcn\_R2017b\_no\_csc.m. In the Simulink file PX4\_Run\_Mode\_R2017b.slx the initialization file is also changed to the latter. Furthermore, if a solution is found for the CSC problem, the InitFcn\_R2017b.m can be used again.
\end{itemize}

\section{Issues:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Uploading issues. Every once and a while, the upload procedure aborts resulting in a failed code upload to the Pixhawk.
	\item CSC Parameters provided by the PSP from Matlab results in an error during building, which is due to the fact that it tries to include a file which has a path which the cmake procedure can not handle. Main guess would be that it includes a space somewhere.
