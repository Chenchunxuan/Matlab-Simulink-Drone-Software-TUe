\chapter{Issues}
List of issues that do not have proper solutions yet:
\begin{itemize}
\item CSC parameters can not yet be included.
\item GPS block obtains height measurement wrongly. NSH terminal shows proper measurements. Possibly try include UORB message bus block to obtain directly the measurement message of the driver. If those values are properly matching NSH messages, then bug can probably be found the the Matlab Simulink GPS block.
\item When uploading code, connection times-out to fast. Therefore connection is not perfectly stable yet. Although the wait time is made longer, it is not a proper solution to the issue. \color{red}Accidentally, when upgrading bootloader to v3, the upload timeout seems not to occur anymore. Follow: \url{https://docs.px4.io/en/advanced_config/bootloader_update.html} to upgrade bootloader to V3. Furthermore, changed uploader script to the ardupilot one \url{https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/Tools/scripts/uploader.py}.\color{black}
\end{itemize}
